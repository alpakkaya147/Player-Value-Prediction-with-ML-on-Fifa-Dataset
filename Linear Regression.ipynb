The reason behind that is to achieve comparability between the variables themselves and therefore finally the ability for the applier to interpret the results in a correct way. In the case of the FIFA dataset however, due to the large data cleaning and the fact that the majority of the variables are per-se within a range of 1 to 99, this could be perceived as not necessary. However, due to the fact that regularization techniques are gonna be applied, scaling is necessary in this case. For Linear regression, scaling is performed equally for consistency reasons. "

    "One fact one has to consider before running linear regression models is implied by the model-name itself. Not every dataset, or in other words not many datasets, can be described with a linear relationship and require therefore a more complex theoretical \"equation\". This limits the scope of application of a comparable models and represents a major drawback in comparison to other machine learning algorithms such as RandomForests or Neural Networks, which are able to handle non-linear relationships in the data. Exactly this is also the reason for the log-transformation in case of this model, in order to receive a linear development of the logged target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the metrics tables above, the overall performance difference between our three main regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge) is only by marginal nature. This confirms the insights we were describing before. The effects of a regularization process depends on the used alpha-parameter. In our case, for the goalkeeper data the by the function chosen alpha-value was close to 0 (0.00015 and 0.004) which results in no penalty on the feature scores. For the fieldplayer data, the alpha mostly was 0.001 and 0.00001. Therefore, we can conclude that the regularization does not have an remarkable effect on the model performance, and a linear regression fulfils the job of predicting football player market values well on its own. However, this is a decision which is based on simplicity reasons. If the circumstances would differ, a regularization technique could be much more useful for a final interpretation of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkable is the fact that for the fieldplayer data, ridge regression performs better according to the absolute error metrics, however not in case of the squared ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we conclude that the normal linear regression is suitable for finally analyzing the market value differences between real values and our model. However, without considering and running the other models in this project, one could guess that the other models could outperform the linear regression model."

This could be a hint that the model is not entirely able to account for the importance of the age of a football player for the market value. However, the value range also needs to be accounted for, as the market values of the old players are anyway very low and a certain error has higher impact on the percentage difference as for players with values in the millions range."
